# 🌱 Basics of JavaScript 

JavaScript is like the Swiss Army knife of the web. It adapts to many styles, shapes data, and brings interactivity to life. Let's unpack the foundations clearly and practically.

---

## 🧠 JavaScript Is a Multi-Paradigm Language

JavaScript supports:

* **Functional Programming** – using functions as building blocks
* **Procedural Programming** – step-by-step instructions
* **Object-Oriented Programming** – organizing code using objects and classes

This flexibility makes JavaScript great for quick scripts and large applications alike.

---

## 📦 Programs, Processes & Storage

### 🧱 Program vs Process

* **Program**: Code you write.
* **Process**: That code while it’s running.

Think of a **recipe (program)** and the **act of cooking (process)**.

### 📂 Variables: Our Digital Buckets

* A variable is a **named container** to store data.
* Variables can be updated and reused during program execution.

🪣 **Analogy**: Variables are labeled buckets — the label is the variable name, and the content is the value inside.

```javascript
let userName = "Arun";
console.log(userName); // Arun
```

---

## 🔐 Keywords in JavaScript

**Keywords** are **reserved words** — they have special meaning and can’t be used as variable names.

Examples:

```javascript
let, const, return, if, else, for, while
```

🚫 `let let = 5;` → ❌ Invalid

👉 Try in your browser console:

```javascript
let x = 10;
console.log(x); // 10
```

---

## 🏷️ Rules for Naming Variables

1. ✅ Can include: letters, digits, `_`, and `$`

   * `score1`, `_user`, `$amount`

2. ❌ Can’t start with a digit

   * `let 1score = 20;` → Invalid
   * `let score1 = 20;` → Valid

3. ❌ No spaces or special characters

   * `let user-name = "John";` → Invalid
   * `let userName = "John";` → Valid

4. ✅ Use **meaningful names**

   * Bad: `let x = 25;`
   * Good: `let userAge = 25;`

5. ❌ Don’t use keywords

   * `let return = 10;` → Invalid

---

## 🖨️ `console.log()` – Debugging’s Best Friend

`console.log()` is a **built-in function** that prints values to the browser console.

```javascript
console.log(10, "hello"); // Output: 10 hello
```

📌 Use it to:

* Inspect variables
* Test values
* Debug code

🔍 Try it in Developer Tools (F12 → Console tab)

---

## 🔢 Primitive Data Types

### 1. **Number**

```javascript
let age = 25;
let temp = -5;
let pi = 3.14;
```

### 2. **String**

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
let greeting = 'Hello';
let template = `Welcome, ${name}`;
```

### 3. **Boolean**

```javascript
let isLoggedIn = true;
let hasAccess = false;
```

Used in conditions:

```javascript
if (isLoggedIn) {
  console.log("Welcome!");
}
```

### 4. **Undefined**

Declared but not assigned:

```javascript
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined
```

🧠 **Concept**: Like reserving a seat but no one is sitting there yet.

## 🗃️ Primitive vs Non-Primitive Data Types

| Type              | Description                            | Example                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Primitive**     | Atomic values, can't be broken further | `let age = 25;`                         |
| **Non-Primitive** | Collections of values                  | `let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };` |

---

## 🧱 Non-Primitive Data Types

### 1. **Objects**

Objects store **key-value pairs**:

```javascript
let user = {
  name: "Arun",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true
};
```

* Keys must be **unique**
* Values can be any data type

### 2. **Nested Objects**

Objects can contain other objects:

```javascript
let company = {
  name: "TechCorp",
  address: {
    city: "Bangalore",
    pin: 560001
  }
};
```

🧠 Think of objects as mini-databases that organize data meaningfully.

---

## 🧯 Null vs Undefined (Key Difference)

### **Null**

Represents a **deliberate empty value**.

```javascript
let profilePicture = null;
```

📦 **Analogy**:

* No roll on the toilet holder = `null`

### **Undefined**

Represents a variable that exists but hasn’t been assigned.

```javascript
let userName;
console.log(userName); // undefined
```

📦 **Analogy**:

* The holder exists, but there’s no roll yet = `undefined`

---

## ✅ Summary

* JS is versatile with multiple programming styles.
* Variables store data; `let` and `const` are your main tools.
* Naming rules help keep code readable.
* Use `console.log()` to inspect your work.
* Know your data types — both primitive and object-based.
* Understand when to use `null` vs `undefined`.

# 🧠 JavaScript Non-Primitive Data Types – Deep Dive 
Data types are how JavaScript sees the world. Some are simple (primitives), others are complex (non-primitives). Let’s focus on **non-primitive** types—the powerhouse structures that let us represent real-world complexity.

---

## 🧱 What Are Non-Primitive Data Types?

Think of non-primitives like **storage boxes with compartments**. Unlike a single number or string, these can store multiple values—often related, sometimes deeply nested.

They’re also called **reference types**, because when we store or copy them, JavaScript handles their *reference* in memory—not the actual data.

---

## 📦 Objects – The Most Fundamental Non-Primitive

Objects are **collections of key-value pairs**. They're the go-to structure when you want to group data logically.

### 💡 Analogy: A backpack with labeled pockets

* `name: "John"` → name tag in one pocket
* `age: 30` → age label in another

### 🧪 Example:

```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true
};
```

### ✅ Rules:

* Keys are strings (or symbols), and **must be unique**
* Values can be any data type (even functions!)

---

## 🧬 Nested Objects – Objects Inside Objects

You can place one object **inside** another, like nesting boxes inside boxes.

### 🔍 Use Case:

Modeling real-world data structures, like a user with an address.

```javascript
let user = {
  name: "Jane",
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    zip: 10001
  }
};

console.log(user.address.city); // New York
```

This is powerful for organizing **hierarchical** or related data.

---

## 🔄 Primitive vs Non-Primitive – Key Differences

| **Type**          | **Description**                           | **Example**                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Primitive**     | Simple values; stored directly            | `let age = 25;`                |
| **Non-Primitive** | Containers of values; stored by reference | `let user = { name: "John" };` |

### 🎯 Real-World Analogy

* **Primitive** = A coin in your hand
* **Non-Primitive** = A wallet holding coins, cards, ID, etc.

---

## 🕳️ Null – A Box You Emptied on Purpose

### What is `null`?

A **deliberate empty value**. You’re telling JavaScript: “This should hold something, but right now, it holds nothing.”

### 🧻 Analogy: The toilet paper roll

* **Has paper** → Non-zero value
* **Empty roll** → Value = 0
* **No roll at all** → `null`

```javascript
let toiletPaper = null; // Roll is missing
```

Use `null` when something is **intentionally absent**.

---

## ❓ Undefined – A Box You Never Filled

### What is `undefined`?

Means a variable **exists but wasn’t given a value**.

### 💡 Analogy:

A shelf is installed (variable declared), but **you haven’t put anything on it yet**.

```javascript
let mug;
console.log(mug); // undefined
```

JavaScript will also return `undefined` if:

* A function doesn’t return anything
* You access a non-existent property

---

## 🧼 Summary – Non-Primitives in a Nutshell

| Concept                    | Description               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Object                     | Key-value store           |
| Nested Object              | Object within an object   |
| Null                       | Explicit empty value      |
| Undefined                  | Declared but not assigned |
| Primitive vs Non-Primitive | Value vs Reference        |

🎒 Use non-primitives when data needs **structure**, **grouping**, or **relationships**.

🚀 When building real-world apps, objects (and arrays) are your **foundation bricks**.
