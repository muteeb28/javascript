# JavaScript Loops

Loops allow us to repeat tasks efficiently, avoiding the need to manually write repetitive code.

## Introduction to Loops

### Example Problem:
Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to 10.  

### Observations:
- There is a repetitive task: printing a number and then moving to the next number.  
- Steps involved:
  1. **Initialize a variable**: Start with `i = 1`.
  2. **Print the current number**: Use a method like `console.log(i)`.
  3. **Move to the next number**: Increment the variable, e.g., `i += 1`.
  4. **Repeat**: Use a loop construct to return to the start of the block and repeat until the desired range is covered.

## How Loops Work

1. **Initialization**:
   - A variable is initialized to start the process.
   
2. **Condition Check**:
   - A condition determines whether the loop should continue or stop.

3. **Execution**:
   - The code inside the loop is executed if the condition is true.

4. **Update**:
   - The loop variable is updated to eventually meet the stopping condition.
