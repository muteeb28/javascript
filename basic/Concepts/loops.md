# JavaScript Loops

Loops allow us to repeat tasks efficiently, avoiding the need to manually write repetitive code.

## Introduction to Loops

## Using a `while` Loop

- A `while` loop executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.

### Logic:
1. **Initialization**: Start with a variable, `i = 1`.
2. **Condition Check**: Ensure `i <= 10`.
3. **Execution**: Print the current number.
4. **Update**: Increment `i` by 1 after each iteration.

## Difference Between `while` and `if`

- **`if` Statement**:  
  - Checks the condition **once**, regardless of whether it's true or false.
  - Used for single-time decisions or actions.

- **`while` Loop**:  
  - Continuously checks the condition **until it becomes false**.
  - Used for repetitive tasks where the condition determines the repetition.

## Summary

- Loops, such as the `while` loop, help automate repetitive tasks.  
- The difference between `while` and `if` lies in repetition:  
  - `if` is a one-time conditional check.  
  - `while` is a repeated check until the condition turns false.  

By understanding and utilizing loops, you can handle tasks requiring repetition more efficiently.
