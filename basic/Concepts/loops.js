// Question write the program to print the numbers from 1-10
//while loop
let i =1; // intializing a variable using which we will loop
while(i<=10){ // checking condition till the time it became false
    console.log(i)
    i +=1;
}

/*
what is the different between while and if 
if will only check the condition once doesnt matter 
if the condition is true or false 
---
where as while loop check the conditon again and again until the condition becomes 
false
