### **Non-Primitive Data Types**

1. **Objects**  
    Objects are used to store **key-value pairs** and provide a flexible way to group related data.
	 -  Keys must be **unique**.
	 
  2.  **Nested Objects**
	Objects can contain other objects, making them a composition of different data types.  
	Example Code:  
 ```

### **Primitive vs Non-Primitive Data Types**

|**Type**|**Description**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Primitive**|Atomic types that exist independently.|`let age = 25;`|
|**Non-Primitive**|Compositions of other types, like objects or arrays.|`let user = {name: "John", age: 30};`|

# 1.5 Other datatypes
1. **Null**
    
    - Represents an **explicitly empty value**.
    - Example: If something no longer exists or is intentionally set as "empty", we use `null`.
    
    **Analogy**: Imagine a toilet paper roll:
    
    - **Non-zero value**: The roll still has paper.
    - **Zero value**: The roll is empty but still exists.
    - **Null**: There’s no roll on the holder.
2. **Undefined**
    
    - Represents a **value that was never assigned** or is **yet to be defined**.
    - Example: Declaring a variable but not assigning a value to it results in `undefined`.
    
    **Analogy**:
    
    - If there’s no holder on the wall, the wall space may later be assigned a holder, a switch, or something else. For now, it’s `undefined`.
