# JavaScript Functions  

## Understanding Functions in JavaScript  

### **Why Do We Need Functions?**  
Functions help us follow the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle**, which promotes code reusability and maintainability.  

### **Common Problems Without Functions**:  
1. **Mistakes**: If a piece of logic is repeated in multiple places, fixing a bug requires making changes everywhere.  
2. **Requirement Changes**: If logic needs modification, updating every instance manually can be time-consuming and error-prone.

## **What Are Functions?**  

A function is like a **black box**â€”you provide an input, it processes the data, and then it gives an output.  

Functions can be:  
- **Built-in (predefined)** functions like `Math.sqrt()` for calculating square roots.  
- **User-defined** functions that allow us to encapsulate logic and reuse it anywhere in the program.

## **Benefits of Using Functions**  
1. **Encapsulation**: Logic is stored inside a function, making code modular.  
2. **Reusability**: The function can be called multiple times instead of rewriting the logic.  
3. **Easy Maintenance**: If a function needs correction or modification, updating it in one place reflects everywhere it's used.  
4. **Improved Readability**: Breaking code into functions makes it more structured and easier to understand.

## **Example of Function Usage**  

- Instead of writing the same logic multiple times, we define a function once and call it whenever needed.  
- This ensures that any updates or corrections are made only once, keeping the code clean and error-free.  

By understanding and using functions effectively, we can write more efficient, organized, and maintainable JavaScript code.
