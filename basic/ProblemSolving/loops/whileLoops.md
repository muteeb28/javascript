# JavaScript While Loop Examples  

This document demonstrates simple use cases of the `while` loop in JavaScript to handle repetitive tasks efficiently.

## Examples of Using `while` Loops  

### **Question 1**: Print Numbers from 1 to 10  

**Logic**:  
1. Initialize a variable `i` to 1.  
2. Use a `while` loop that runs as long as `i <= 10`.  
3. Print the value of `i` in each iteration.  
4. Increment `i` by 1 to move to the next number.

### **Question 2**: Calculate the Sum of Numbers from 1 to 10  

**Logic**:  
1. Initialize `j = 1` and `sum = 0`.  
2. Use a `while` loop that runs until `j > 10`.  
3. Add the value of `j` to `sum` during each iteration.  
4. Increment `j` by 1 to include the next number in the sum.  
5. Print the total sum after exiting the loop.

### **Question 3**: Print Numbers from 20 to 1 in Decreasing Order  

**Logic**:  
1. Start with `k = 20`.  
2. Use a `while` loop that continues as long as `k >= 1`.  
3. Print the value of `k` during each iteration.  
4. Decrement `k` by 1 to move to the next smaller number.  

**Note**: The loop variable must be correctly decremented to avoid an infinite loop or incorrect output.

## Key Benefits of Using Loops  

1. **Automation**: Reduce repetitive tasks with a structured approach.  
2. **Flexibility**: Easily modify the range or conditions for iteration.  
3. **Efficiency**: Optimize logic to handle repetitive operations with minimal code.
