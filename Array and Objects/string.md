Got it! Let's create a **separate Josh Comeau–inspired section** just for **string interpolation** in JavaScript. Here's the standalone version:

# 🎙️ JavaScript String Interpolation – The Friendly Way to Build Strings

We’ve all had moments where we need to stitch together some values and form a sentence. Maybe something like:

> "John works at Amazon."

Sure, you could use the old-school `+` operator. But JavaScript offers something much friendlier—**string interpolation** using **template literals**.

---

## 🧵 The Classic Way (String Concatenation)

```js
let name = "John";
let company = "Amazon";

let sentence = name + " works at " + company;
console.log(sentence); // John works at Amazon
```

It works… but it’s noisy, repetitive, and hard to read—especially with longer strings.

---

## ✨ Enter Template Literals (aka Interpolated Strings)

Template literals are string expressions wrapped in **backticks** (\` \`), not quotes.

Inside them, you can embed **dynamic values** using `${}`—just like putting ingredients into a recipe.

```js
let name = "John";
let company = "Amazon";

let sentence = `${name} works at ${company}`;
console.log(sentence); // John works at Amazon
```

🎉 Much cleaner. Easier to read. No `+` signs everywhere.

---

## 📦 Embedding Any JavaScript Expression

The curly braces `${}` can do more than just hold variables—they can evaluate **any valid expression**.

```js
let years = 2;
let name = "Ravi";
let company = "Grapus";

let sentence = `${name} works at ${company} for more than ${years} years.`;
console.log(sentence); // Ravi works at Grapus for more than 2 years.
```

Want to get fancy?

```js
let result = `Interpolated example: ${2 + 3 - 9}`;
console.log(result); // Interpolated example: -4
```

---

## 🧪 Why Use Interpolation?

* Clean, readable syntax
* No more awkward `+` signs
* Supports full JavaScript expressions
* Easy to store and reuse

---

## 📝 Syntax Recap

```js
let message = `Your order number is ${orderId}, placed on ${new Date()}`;
```

* Use **backticks** to define the template.
* Use **`${expression}`** to embed values.

### Bonus: Multi-line Strings 📄

Template literals also make multi-line strings easier:

```js
let multiline = `
This is line one.
This is line two.
No weird \n or + signs.
`;
